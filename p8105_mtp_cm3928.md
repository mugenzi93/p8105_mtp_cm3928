# Introduction

Smart device use in relation to the deformation of millenial’s skulls
have been a source of controversy for the last few years. Research
studies have been conducuted examining this very issue and some found
strong evidence connecting smart device use to an enlarged “hornlike”
spike at the back of the head, a formation mostly found in millenials.
This project uses data analysis concepts to expands on one of those
studies and uses data collected in order to refute or support
conclusions made in that study.

# Data Description

## Loading and tidying the dataset

**Briefly describe the data cleaning process and the resulting dataset,
identifying key variables based on your understanding of the original
scientific report. How many participants are included? What is the age
and gender distribution (a human-readable table may help here)?**

This dataset is comprised of **8** variables and **1221** observations
which is also the number representative of how many participants were
studied by the original scientific report. The orginal dataset had 9
variables but I eliminated the shape variable for the purpose of this
assignment.
