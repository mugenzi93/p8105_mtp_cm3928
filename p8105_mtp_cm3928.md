# Introduction

Smart device use in relation to the deformation of millenial’s skulls
have been a source of controversy for the last few years. Research
studies have been conducuted examining this very issue and some found
strong evidence connecting smart device use to an enlarged “hornlike”
spike at the back of the head, a formation mostly found in millenials.
This project uses data analysis concepts to expands on one of those
studies and uses data collected in order to refute or support
conclusions made in that study.

# Data Description

## Loading and tidying the dataset
